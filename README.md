<h2>Hello, gorgeous! ðŸ‘‹</h2>
I'm a backend web developer with a focus on the MERN stack. <br>
I'm still exploring other technologies and frameworks that catch or requires my interest. <br>
I'm open to volunteer work. <br>
Iâ€™m also looking to collaborate with programmers to work on projects and up my skill. <br>
