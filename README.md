ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Canice Ezugwu
<hr>
I'm a backend web developer with a focus on the MERN stack. <br>
I'm still exploring other technologies and frameworks that catch or requires my interest. <br>
See some of my works in [My Portfolio](https://canicemikk.netlify.app/) <br>
I'm open to volunteer work. <br>
Iâ€™m also looking to collaborate with programmers to work on projects and up my skill. <br>
